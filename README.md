AddToReminiscence-Chromium-Extension
====================================

[This extension for the Google Chrome-/Chromium-Browser](https://github.com/s3h10r/AddToReminiscence-Chromium-Extension.git) adds a button to your toolbar which lets you add the current page you're browsing to your Reminiscence instance. Currently, all pages will be saved to the 'AddToReminiscence' directory.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This extension requires a seperate Reminiscence instance. Reminiscence is a self hosted bookmarking & archiving server, which is open source software and available here: https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence

This is a port of the [original Firefox-AddOn "AddToReminiscense"](https://gitlab.com/NordicDev/AddToReminiscence) by Alec Papierniak / NordicDev.

Hope i didn't add much bugs while porting it to Chromium. The original FF-AddOn works pretty good - so for everything which doesn't work in Chrome blame me. [Patches/PRs welcome](https://github.com/s3h10r/AddToReminiscence-Chromium-Extension.git).
